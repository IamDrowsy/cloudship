Cloudship is a Clojure toolkit to explore and manipulate your salesforce instances.
It's designed to work from the repl against many different orgs and supports

* Auth Data from different Sources
** Username + Password or Session in Configuration
** Username + Password in Keepass
** sfdx
** oauth (not yet)
* Extensions to Configuration
** connect via CipherCloud
** your own extension
* Convenient methods taking and returning Clojure Datastructures
** SOAP-Api
** Bulk-Api
** Meta-Api

== Usage



== Connection Creation
Every function that talks to a Salesforce Org takes the connection
as first argument. This can be either:

* an `Org` Record
* a Map of connection properties
* a keyword

When working with many orgs from the repl we recommend to configure the usage
of keywords. The resulting connections will be cached and manged for you.

If you don't care about the internals, you can jump to the <<Resolve Examples>>

=== From Keyword
A keyword that describes a connection has the following syntax:
```
:org-name[:sandbox-name][.flag|.flag:opt]*
```
where the org-name can be choosen freely,
sandbox-name is the name of the sandbox you want to connect to
and flag / flag:opt are modifiers that can change what your
connection properties look like before the connection is created
(see <<Resolving Flags>>).

Given a keyword as connection, cloudship will do the following:

. check if there is a cached `Org` Record for this keyword
. if not, build a property map from the keyword by
.. parsing the keyword into a initial prop map (with `:org-name` `:sandbox` `:flags` and `:full` (original kw) as keys)
.. deep-merges all found `cloudship.edn` in `resource-folder`, `%user-home/.cloudship`,
   `current folder` (in this order) to a big config map.
.. deep-merges to a final prop map
... all entries (except `:orgs`) of config map (b.)
... the initial prop map (a.)
... all entries in `[:orgs :org-name]` of config map
... all entries in `[:orgs :org-name :sandboxes "sandbox-name"]` of config-map
.. continue with the <<From Property Map>>

This process is a bit complex to provide a trade-off between ease and flexibility
 of configuration and usage.

For the most part you don't need to care about these details.
Just follow the <<Tutorial>> and you will get the idea.

=== From Property Map

Given a property map, cloudship will try to create an `Org` Record by

. add or coerce api-version (currently default is `41.0`)
. build base-url from `:sandbox`, `:instance` and `:my-domain`
** providing nothing will result in `login.salesforce.com`
** only sandbox will result in `test.salesforce.com`
** only my-domain will result in `<my-domain>.my.salesforce.com`
** my-domain, sandbox needs the instance (e.g. "86") as this cannot be resolved
   and will result in `<my-domain>--<sandbox>.cs<instance>.my.salesforce.com`
. <<Resolving Flags>>
. add `https://` to url if missing
. add `.<sandbox>` to username if target is sandbox and it's missing

After this, the property map should conform to the following spec:
[source,clojure]
----
include::{sourcedir}/cloudship/connection/props/spec.clj[lines=27..29]
----

==== Resolving Flags

Flags are instructions to modify the connection properties before trying to
create the `Org` Record.

A Flag can either be a simple String or a Map with `{:flag-name string? ...}`.
The Multimethod `cloudship.connection.props.flags/resolve-flag` is called
on the flag and needs to return a function `Property Map -> Property Map`.

All Flags are resolved and applied in order until there are no more left.

The following flags are included:

* `v` - Version flag that sets the version to it's opt e.g. `v:39`.
* `kp` - Keepass, reads username and password from a keepass file.
** needs `:kpdb` and `:kppath` (vector of path in keepath db).
** `:kppass` can be set, otherwise will be prompted.
* `sfdx` gets session by calling `sfdx:force:org:display -u $usernameOrAlias]`
** needs sfdx in path
** uses `:username` or `:org` as `$usernameOrAlias`
* `cc` - CipherCloud, changes the url to a CipherCloud url.
** needs `:cc-domain` and `:cc-alias`.
** you probably won't need this.

=== Resolve Examples

Given the `cloudship.edn`
[source,clojure]
----
include::{exampledir}/cloudship-example.edn[]
----
the keywords will result in the following property maps
[source,clojure]
----
(->props :org1) =>
    {:api-version "40.0",
     :full :org1,
     :org "org1",
     :password "very-secret1!",
     :url "https://login.salesforce.com",
     :username "my@username.de"}

(->props :org1:new) =>
; api-version is overwritten in config
; username and url are adjusted for the sandbox
    {:api-version "41.0",
     :base-username "my@username.de",
     :full :org1:new,
     :org "org1",
     :password "very-secret1!",
     :sandbox "new",
     :url "https://test.salesforce.com",
     :username "my@username.de.new"}

(->props :org1:other) =>
; nothing is overwritten, but username/url are adjusted for the sandbox
    {:api-version "40.0",
     :base-username "my@username.de",
     :full :org1:other,
     :org "org1",
     :password "very-secret1!",
     :sandbox "other",
     :url "https://test.salesforce.com",
     :username "my@username.de.other"}

(->props :org1.v:39) =>
; version is adjusted by the flag
    {:api-version "39.0",
     :full :org1.v:39,
     :org "org1",
     :password "very-secret1!",
     :resolved-flags [{:flag-name "v", :opt "39"}],
     :url "https://login.salesforce.com",
     :username "my@username.de"}
